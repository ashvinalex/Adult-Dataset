# Adult Dataset Analysis with Logistic Regression and K-Means

Welcome to my personal project repository for analyzing the Adult dataset using Logistic Regression and K-Means clustering! This repository is a testament to my journey in exploring the dataset, building classification models, and applying unsupervised clustering techniques.

## Overview

The Adult dataset presents an interesting challenge in predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year, making it a valuable case study for classification and clustering tasks.

## Key Features of My Personal Project

1. **Data Exploration**: Dive into my journey of understanding the Adult dataset, including data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering.

2. **Logistic Regression**: Follow my process of implementing Logistic Regression models to predict income levels based on various features. Explore how I fine-tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance.

3. **K-Means Clustering**: Witness my exploration of unsupervised learning with K-Means clustering. I'll show you how I apply the algorithm, optimize the number of clusters, and interpret the results.

4. **Feature Selection**: Explore my use of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify and select the most important features for classification. I'll explain why certain features play a crucial role in predicting income levels.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Learn about the evaluation metrics I employ to assess the Logistic Regression models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Understand how these metrics help in gauging model effectiveness.

6. **Clustering Evaluation**: Dive into the evaluation of K-Means clustering results using the silhouette_score. I'll discuss how this metric measures cluster quality.

7. **Interactive Visualizations**: Engage with interactive visualizations and insightful plots that help uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.
